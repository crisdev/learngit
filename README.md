Short notes
===========

The purpose of this repository is to *practice* with some git commands.

~~It will be deleted shortly after that.~~

Quoting a text is an easy task:

> Life is a tale
> told by an idiot

> William Shakespeare

Then a bit of code. In this case, some FORTRAN:

```FORTRAN
PROGRAM Test
  IMPLICIT NONE
  REAL, PARAMETER :: PI = ACOS(-1.0)

  PRINT *, "Value of PI is ", PI
END PROGRAM Test
```

But you can always ´import  code´ using backtics.

It's a good way to also learn some [markdown][] in the way tough. :smile:

Some Java here:

```java
public Class automovil {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		automovil Peugeot = new automovil("Peugeot", 405);
	}
}
```
