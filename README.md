Short notes
===========

The purpose of this repository is to *practice* with some git commands. 

~~It will be deleted shortly after that.~~

Now, inserting images seems to be an easy task:

And quoting a text:

Then a bit of code. In this case, some FORTRAN:

```FORTRAN
PROGRAM Test
  IMPLICIT NONE
  REAL, PARAMETER :: PI = ACOS(-1.0)

  PRINT *, "Value of PI is ", PI
END PROGRAM Test
```

It's a good way to also learn some [markdown][] in the way tough. :smile:

- [x] Watch a movie
- [ ] Learn to code

Some Java here:

```java
public Class automovil {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		automovil Peugeot = new automovil("Peugeot", 405);
	}
}
```
